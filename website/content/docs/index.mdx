# Introduction

**fetta** is a text splitting library with built-in kerning compensation for smooth text animations.

## Why fetta?

When you split text into individual characters or words for animation, browsers lose kerning information — the subtle spacing adjustments between character pairs that make text look balanced. This causes characters to shift position, making animations look janky.

**fetta solves this** by measuring character positions before splitting, then applying CSS margin adjustments after splitting to preserve the original spacing.

## Features

- **Kerning Compensation** — Maintains original character spacing after splitting
- **Responsive AutoSplit** — Re-splits on container resize
- **Auto-Revert** — Restore original HTML after animations
- **Line Detection** — Automatically groups words into lines
- **Built-in InView** — Viewport detection with `inView`, `onInView`, `onLeaveView`
- **TypeScript** — Full type definitions included
- **Framework Agnostic** — Use with vanilla JS or React

## Quick Example

```tsx
import { SplitText } from 'fetta/react';
import { animate, stagger } from 'motion';

function AnimatedHeading() {
  return (
    <SplitText
      onSplit={({ words }) => {
        animate(
          words,
          { opacity: [0, 1], y: [20, 0] },
          { delay: stagger(0.05) }
        );
      }}
    >
      <h1>Smooth text animation</h1>
    </SplitText>
  );
}
```

## Works With Any Animation Library

fetta works with **Motion**, **GSAP**, **Anime.js**, **CSS animations**, or the **Web Animations API**.
